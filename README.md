# React Task Tracker

This is my second project with React, in which I used __Hooks__, __React Router__ and a fake __database API__ (Json Server)

It's a web app to keep track of _tasks_. You can assign a _priority_ by double clicking the task. It's served by a database so it will keep track of any task edit.

It's an app that I built just to learn and practice React, it doesn't mean to be an original piece or extremely functional.
