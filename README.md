This is my second project with React, in which I used __Hooks__, __React Router__ and a fake __database API__ (Json Server).

It's a web app UI to keep track of _tasks_. You can assign a _priority_ by double clicking the task. 

It's been initially developed to locally fetch a fake REST API. Just find the commented code in App.js to refactor it and try it in your environment. I removed the fake database to deploy the UI demo which doesn't persist the data.

It's an app that I built just to learn and practice React, it doesn't mean to be an original piece or visually appealing.
